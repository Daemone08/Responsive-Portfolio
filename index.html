            <p class="info">What makes a man? Is it his gruff exterior? Is it his dedication to those he loves? Is it his dream to one day build a cabin in the mountains to escape the hustle and bustle of city life? Or is it a collection of energy particles all vibrating at the same frequency just like anything else in this universe.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="info">What makes me a man? I have conquered demons. I have corrected gross injustices. I have loved. And I have lost. Why so dramatic? We only get one go at life.</p>
